# 💡 Advanced Usage Examples

## Business Intelligence Queries

- **Sales Trend Analysis**
  - Aggregate revenue data across regions and time periods
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT region, DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month, SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue
    FROM sales_data
    GROUP BY region, month
    ORDER BY region, month;
    ```

- **Customer Segmentation**
  - Group users by purchase frequency and average spend
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count, AVG(order_value) AS avg_spend
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 AND AVG(order_value) > 100;
    ```

- **Product Performance Comparison**
  - Compare sales volumes between SKUs
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT product_sku, SUM(quantity_sold) AS total_units
    FROM inventory_sales
    GROUP BY product_sku
    ORDER BY total_units DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

## Financial Analysis

- **Quarterly Expense Reporting**
  - Summarize expenses by category and quarter
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT category, DATE_TRUNC('quarter', expense_date) AS quarter, SUM(amount) AS total_expenses
    FROM expense_records
    GROUP BY category, quarter
    ORDER BY quarter, category;
    ```

- **Profit & Loss Calculation**
  - Calculate net profit based on income and expense streams
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT 
      DATE_TRUNC('month', transaction_date) AS month,
      SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'income' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS total_income,
      SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'expense' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS total_expenses,
      (SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'income' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) - 
       SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'expense' THEN amount ELSE 0 END)) AS net_profit
    FROM financial_transactions
    GROUP BY month
    ORDER BY month;
    ```

- **Budget Variance Analysis**
  - Compare actual spending against budgeted amounts
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT 
      department, 
      budget_amount, 
      SUM(actual_spent) AS actual_spent,
      (budget_amount - SUM(actual_spent)) AS variance
    FROM department_budgets
    LEFT JOIN expense_reports ON department_budgets.department = expense_reports.department
    GROUP BY department, budget_amount
    ORDER BY variance DESC;
    ```

# 🔧 Prompt Engineering Innovation

## Context-Aware Template System
### Dynamic Schema Integration

```python
def build_context_prompt(schema, question, template_tier):
    """
    Advanced prompt construction with:
    - Business domain knowledge injection
    - Schema relationship mapping
    - Performance optimization hints
    - Security constraint enforcement
    """
    context = {
        'schema_summary': extract_business_entities(schema),
        'relationship_map': analyze_foreign_keys(schema),
        'optimization_hints': generate_performance_hints(schema),
        'security_rules': apply_business_constraints()
    }
    return render_template(template_tier, context, question)
```

## Multi-Tier Response Quality

| Template Tier | Use Case                   | Avg Response Time | Accuracy  |
|---------------|----------------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Basic         | Simple queries, fast prototyping | < 1 second         | 85%       |
| Production    | Standard business queries   | < 2 seconds        | 92%       |
| Enterprise    | Complex analytics, BI reports | < 3 seconds        | 95%+      |

## Business Logic Integration

```python
# Domain-specific calculation patterns
FINANCIAL_PATTERNS = {
    'profit_margin': '(gross_price - manufacturing_cost) / gross_price * 100',
    'total_cost': 'manufacturing_cost + (gross_price * freight_pct)',
    'net_price': 'gross_price * (1 - discounts_pct - other_deductions_pct)',
    'roi_analysis': '(revenue - total_cost) / total_cost * 100'
